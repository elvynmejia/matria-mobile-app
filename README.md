## Pre-dependencies
Might need to install android studio and X-Code


Use the following node version, managed through nvm
```bash
 nvm use v20.9.0
```

## install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run android # start the android simulator
npm run ios # start the ios simulator
```

Happy coding!
